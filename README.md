# Meshing: Introduction   
Here, we will present you a meshing program called "maillage" in French. Meshing means dividing a domain for example a rectangular one into a set of triangle pieces perfectly superposed.  
## Context  
Many issues in real life lead scientists to adopt a **scientifical approach** to respond correctly to these issues. This scientifical approach requires to perform **mathematical operations**. **For instance**, if we want to determine the temperature of a specific point of warmed plate using given temperatures of some area, Scientist will use scientific tools to respond to that question. Among these scientific tools, we can name **operations on matrix, meshing of a domain, etc**.  

Actually, some of these operations are very hard to realize by a human. Because of the huge amount of data processing and the performance speed needed to perform some complex operations. So human rely on the capabilities of computers in term of time processing and storage to be able to response to issues faced in real life.  

## Problematic  
Scientist need to perform some mathematical operations using computer. So there are plenty of programs to implement to automate those operations. Here, we will focus on **creating a program to perform meshing operations in a convex domain**.
How to implement such a program?

## Goals  
- Being able to represent a convex domain in machin  
- Being able to mesh this domain  
# Features of the program  
This meshing program has many features:  
- User can *create, modify or delete* a **visible convex domain**;  
- After the convex domain is printed, User can **launch meshing operation** in this domain;  
- Alternatively, user can charge a file containing **already meshed domain**, for mor ease;  
- For a more friendly look to the meshing result printed, user can **zoom** the domain;  
- Finally, he can **save** the meshing result in a file to be downloaded for future use;

# Running the program  
Here, we will perform step by step actions to:  
- Create a **new convex domain**;  
- Proceed to the **meshing operation** of this domain:  
- **Save** the meshed domain on **a file** for future use;
